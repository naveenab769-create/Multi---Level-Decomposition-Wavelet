Project Title :

Multi-Level Wavelet Decomposition (Level 1–3) for Image Analysis using DWT

Project Description :

This project implements Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to perform multi-resolution analysis (MRA) on grayscale images.
The image is decomposed into Approximation (LL) and Detail (LH, HL, HH) sub-bands up to Level-3, enabling effective texture and frequency-based feature extraction.

Wavelet coefficients are further analyzed using statistical features like Energy,Entropy, Mean, and Standard Deviation, which are widely used in medical imaging, texture classification, and pattern recognition.

Objectives of the Project :

•To perform multi-level (Level 1–3) wavelet decomposition on grayscale images
•To visualize horizontal, vertical, and diagonal details at each decomposition level
•To extract statistical features from wavelet sub-bands
•To understand frequency-domain representation of images
•To prepare a feature vector suitable for machine learning / image classification tasks

Why Wavelet Decomposition?

Traditional image analysis methods like Fourier Transform fail to provide spatial + frequency localization.
Wavelet Transform solves this problem.

✔ Advantages of Wavelets:

•Provides multi-resolution analysis
•Captures both spatial and frequency information
•Works well for non-stationary signals (images are non-stationary)
•Efficient for edge, texture, and noise analysis

That’s why wavelets are heavily used in:

•MRI / CT image analysis
•Texture classification
•Image compression (JPEG2000)
•Feature extraction for ML models

Why Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)?
 
•DWT is computationally efficient
•Suitable for digital images
•Produces compact and meaningful coefficients
•Easy to extract statistical features from sub-bands

In this project, Daubechies (db2) wavelet is used because:
•It provides better smoothness than Haar
•Preserves important image details
•Commonly used in real-world image processing tasks

Methodology / Technique Used :
 
•Load grayscale image (or generate synthetic image)
•Apply 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform
•Decompose image into:
  LL → Approximation
  LH → Horizontal details
  HL → Vertical details
  HH → Diagonal details
•Perform decomposition up to Level 3
•Visualize wavelet sub-bands

Extract statistical features:

•Energy
•Entropy
•Mean
•Standard Deviation
•Store features as a structured feature vector

📊 Output of the Program :

The program was tested using real-world images such as a rose and a cat. For each image, multi-level (Level 1–3) wavelet decomposition is performed, producing approximation and detail sub-bands. The output includes clear visualization of texture and edge details along with extracted statistical features forming a final feature vector.

These features can be directly used for:

•Image classification
•Disease detection (MRI / CT)
•Texture analysis

Tools & Libraries :

•Python
•OpenCV
•PyWavelets
•NumPy
•Matplotlib
•Pandas

Applications :

•Medical image analysis
•Image denoising
•Texture classification
•Pattern recognition
•Pre-processing for AI / ML models

👉🏻 This project demonstrates how wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis can effectively represent image information across different frequency bands, making it suitable for advanced image processing and machine learning applications.
