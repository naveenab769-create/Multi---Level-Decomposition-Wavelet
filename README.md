# Multi---Level-Decomposition-Wavelet
This project performs multi-level (Level 1–3) Discrete Wavelet Transform on grayscale images for multi-resolution analysis. The image is decomposed into approximation and detail sub-bands, and statistical features like energy, entropy, mean, and standard deviation are extracted for image analysis and classification tasks.
